    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  \n",

    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./advance_lane_finding.ipynb\". \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline (single images)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image. Here is an example of my output for this step. \n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function as described below, takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def warper(img, src, dst):\n",
    "    # Compute and apply perpective transform\n",
    "    img_size = (img.shape[1], img.shape[0])\n",
    "    M = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(src, dst)\n",
    "    warped = cv2.warpPerspective(img, M, img_size, flags=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)  # keep same size as input image\n",
    "    return warped    \n",
    "````\n",
    "I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def transfpoints(image):\n",
    "    img_size = (image.shape[1],image.shape[0])\n",
    "    src = np.float32(\n",
    "    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 45, img_size[1] / 2 + 95],\n",
    "    [((img_size[0] / 4) - 8), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 45, img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 45), img_size[1] / 2 + 95]])\n",
    "\n",
    "    dst = np.float32(\n",
    "    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return src, dst\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine where the lanes are, I first created an histogram of color intensity.![alt text][image6] I then implemented a sliding window algorithm on the histogram which allowed me to identify segment of lanes. These lane segments were fitted with a 2nd order polynomial function to extract the lanes curvature.\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation used to obtained the radius of curavture could be found [here](https://www.intmath.com/applications-differentiation/8-radius-curvature.php). \n",
    "The distance from the center of the lane is calculated using the polyfit line extended from the middle of the image provided by the middle of the car's onboard camera to the bottom of the image. .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline (video)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_out.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determining the source ands destination points is a time consumming trial and error exercise, and an automated process to find these points could be useful.\n",
    "* While the pipeline performs quite well on the project video, it did not so well on the challenge video because of uneven pavement lightning and lane changing situation. The pipeline utterly failed on the harder challenge video because of large curvature. \n"
